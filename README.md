# POTUS-hashtag-sentiment-analysis
This is a machine learning class project. This project's goal in using the Twitter API is to collect tweet data that use the hashtag POTUS and through Supervised Learning, teach the machine to recognize sentiment in tweets. From the capability of analyzing sentiment, we plan to use the algorithm, with Naive Bayes and SVM, to predict how users will react to a new presidential policy or issue.
